# Find Beacon's Major and Minor Values


[if you change this part you can use program for your product.](https://github.com/aniltaskiran/find-beacons-major-minor/blob/master/Beacon's%20Major-Minor/ViewController.swift#L20)

```swift
    let uuid = UUID(uuidString: "B0702880-A295-A8AB-F734-031A98A512DE")!
    // You must change uuid for your product
```


I used [MactsAsBeacon](https://github.com/timd/MactsAsBeacon) which is tiny app to turn a Bluetooth LE-equipped Mac into an iBeacon.



This program tested on Iphone 4s Ios 9.
